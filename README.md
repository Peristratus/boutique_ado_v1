 ## Description

 This Final milestone project is part of my on going Full Stack Software Developer course at Canadian Business college in collaboration with the Code Instititute.
 The website/ Web app is based on a fictional E-commerce site called Boutique Ado , the app's theme is based on an online store and their services to the general public.The user(s) will be able to 
 interact with the web app, navigate through the site, register as a user and have a user profile page. Buy products and items as a registered or non registered user, the information will be submitted into django database. 
 The user will also be able to interact with an Artificial Intelligent chat bot that speaks to the user(s), assist the user in navigating through the web app using voice commmands, suggest items to buy, inform the user 
 about sale offers. The AI is able to have a meaningful conversation with the user and interact in small talk not related to the shopping experience . The site is fully functional with Stripe payment API and Webhooks 
 incorporated with the Stripe payment system. The Web app is a fully integrated front-end and backend django web app.

## Technologies 

The technologies employed to develop this web application was based on the principles of Design for X (DFX) also know as Design for excellence, the basis of this methodology is based
on cost to quality, making effective use of resources to minimize cost and relay more on innovation and technical knowledge to meet the users expectations.The software's used are mostly free 
and meet the **Requirements Traceability Catalog Table 1.0** to develop this website, innovation and technical knowledge was based on my recently aquired skills based on my journey so 
far with Code institute and the Canadian Business College.

Technologies deployed on this project:

 1. Languages deployed on project HTML,CSS,JavaScript and python.
 2. Frame work utilized on project [django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/) and [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/).
 3. django [database](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/databases/)
 4. Webapp live deployment with [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
 5. Libaries utilized on project in requirements.txt

 ## Deployment 

 After my User Acceptance Testing (UAT) I pushed the final version of my code to git hub , in my commit message I cataloged each change before my final push, the steps I took 
 can be seen below. 

 1. Complete the User UAT evaluation and made sure that all codes are funtional and operational.
 2. Used git commit -m to catalog all my changes in line with UAT requirement.
 3. Used git push to push my final version to my git hub repository. 
 

 Before my final push on github I had already deployed my project on Herouku to check connectivity and I clicked on the automatic deploy from master to ensure that all changes on github are reflected on heroku.
 Steps for deployment can be seen below, my project is now live on Heroku [Boutique-ado](https://boutique-ado-cbc.herokuapp.com/)
 

 1. Installed libaries and logged them in requitements.txt
 2. Create the PROCFILE
 3. Login to Heroku 
 4. Click on create new app
 5. Choose app name
 6. Choose country USA
 7. Click on Navlink Deploy
 8. Connect github Peristratus respository to Heroku
 9. Click on reveal config vars insert AWS access ID and keys, Database urls, Email host pass/ user, and the STRIPE secret key values, save them.
 10. Click on Automatic deploy master branch 
 11. Click on Deploy branch and wait for Heroku to build the logs and deploy the webapp.
